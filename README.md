# Introduction
CreditBridge, a real-time, AI-driven credit assessment platform for applicants with limited or no credit history. It should leverage alternative data sources like rent, utility, and mobile payments while detecting synthetic identity fraud. The system must ensure explainability, fairness, and compliance with regulatory standards. The goal is to deliver accurate and transparent credit decisions in under 60 seconds, even without traditional credit data.

# Objective
The primary objective is to develop a next-generation credit scoring solution that drives financial inclusion for thin-file applicants without compromising on security or compliance. We aim to build an end-to-end platform that collects and processes alternative financial and behavioral data, detects fraud in real-time, generates explainable credit scores, and actively monitors for bias. Our solution is designed to significantly improve loan approval rates among the underbanked while maintaining over 99% fraud detection accuracy and meeting regulatory standards. Through this project, we demonstrate both technical feasibility and the potential for real-world impact in inclusive lending.
